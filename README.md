# FriendFinder
This is a full-stack web app used to find compatible friends based on a users input to 10 personality questions. 

The application was built as part of an assignment at the October - February coding bootcamp at UT Austin. It utilizes Javascript/Jquery, and
NPM Express for routing. The comparison functionality is handled in the routing to find the best match based on the user's input.

## How to use
When you open the app, you will be taken to a homepage, from there you can go to survey where you will be asked to enter our name and a link
to a photo. Use dropdowns to answer your personality questions, and you will be given details of the person who scored closest to you on the survey.

### Difficulties
This was quite a challenging assignment based on where my coding proficiency is at the time. With assistance from other developers, I was able to
get to the point where the best match could be calculated, although I am yet to get the results to display properly. I would really 
like to come back and complete this one at another time.
